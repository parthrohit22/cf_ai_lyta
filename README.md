## Overview

LYTA is a portfolio-grade AI workspace built on Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and Workers AI. It is designed to demonstrate more than a prompt box: it models user state, file memory, retrieval, streaming, and output capture as a real product system.

The current product experience is intentionally minimal. The interface focuses on a quiet workspace rail, readable chat, reusable files, cited answers, and a document-style output board.

## What LYTA Does

- Starts immediately in guest mode with temporary server-backed workspace state.
- Supports account workspaces for persisted chats, files, profile data, and preferences.
- Ingests PDFs, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, CSV, JSON, HTML, XML, and images.
- Stores uploaded documents in a reusable file library instead of treating every upload as a one-off attachment.
- Retrieves relevant file snippets and returns source citations in chat and on the output board.
- Streams assistant responses over Server-Sent Events.
- Provides `Instant`, `Deep`, and `Creative` response modes.
- Generates short chat titles and follow-up prompts.
- Lets users pin strong assistant responses to a board for copy or Markdown export.

## Why This Is Technically Interesting

Most AI demos are stateless chat screens. LYTA is structured around explicit ownership boundaries:

- **Worker Router** resolves guest/account identity, validates requests, coordinates retrieval, and forwards normalized chat work.
- **AuthDirectory Durable Object** owns account records, password hashes, auth sessions, and token validation.
- **Workspace Durable Object** owns profile data, preferences, chat index, file metadata, document chunks, embeddings, and library search.
- **Conversation Durable Object** owns per-chat memory, ordered writes, summarization, title generation, follow-ups, and streaming persistence.
- **Workers AI** provides both chat generation and embedding generation.

The streaming path is hardened for demo reliability. `/chat/stream` establishes a valid SSE response before the model call runs, and model/retrieval failures degrade into clean LYTA errors instead of leaking Cloudflare 1101 HTML into the UI. Chat responses also include `X-Lyta-Request-Id` for log correlation, while logs avoid prompts, file text, emails, tokens, and full user data.

## Demo Walkthrough

1. Open the [live demo](https://lyta.parthrohit-dev.workers.dev).
2. Start as a guest and ask a technical question.
3. Upload a document and ask LYTA to summarize risks, decisions, or next steps.
4. Reuse the uploaded file from the library in another chat.
5. Compare `Instant`, `Deep`, and `Creative` response modes.
6. Pin a response to the output board and copy or download it.
7. Sign in to move from temporary guest state to a saved account workspace.

### Core Building Blocks

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `pages/` | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS workspace UI, uploads, auth modal, streaming chat, board |
| `src/router.ts` | Principal resolution, route validation, guest/account routing, library retrieval orchestration |
| `AuthDirectory` | Account records, password hashing, session tokens |
| `Workspace` | Profile, preferences, chat index, reusable file library, vector search |
| `Conversation` | Per-chat state, summaries, titles, follow-ups, SSE streaming, persistence |
| `services/ai.ts` / `services/embeddings.ts` | Workers AI model and embedding calls with normalized failures |

More detail lives in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Feature Inventory

### Implemented

- Guest and account workspace modes
- Email/password account registration and login
- Persistent chat sessions for account workspaces
- Temporary guest sessions with isolated server-backed state
- File upload and browser-side document text extraction
- Reusable workspace file library
- Embedding-backed file retrieval with citations
- SSE streaming chat responses
- Response modes: `Instant`, `Deep`, `Creative`
- Chat title generation, summarization, and follow-up prompts
- Minimal output board with copy and Markdown download
- Request-id based chat error correlation
- Graceful degradation for AI/retrieval failures

### Known Tradeoffs

- Guest state is temporary and scoped to the guest cookie.
- Auth is email/password based, not OAuth or magic link.
- Retrieval uses Durable Object state rather than a dedicated external vector database.
- Browser-side extraction keeps the architecture compact but does not replace server-side OCR.
- The output board is a focused Markdown capture pane, not a full artifact runtime.

- Web research mode with explicit external citations
- Shareable board outputs or published artifact pages
- OAuth or magic-link authentication
- Retrieval quality metrics and latency dashboards
- Richer artifact generation beyond Markdown export

## Repo Quality Goals

LYTA is structured to be readable by reviewers:

- clear product story and live demo path
- explicit state ownership boundaries
- architecture diagrams that match implementation
- minimal frontend without framework overhead
- failure handling that preserves product polish during AI or retrieval issues
